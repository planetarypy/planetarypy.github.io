    <p>This document describes the procedure for proposing, reviewing, and
making a decision about PlanetaryPy-affiliated packages. This is
meant as a record of the PlanetaryPy procedure and eventually we'll
have more detailed instructions on proposing an affiliated package,
like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html">Astropy does</a>.</p>
<section id="proposing-an-affiliated-package"><h2>Proposing an affiliated package</h2>
<p><em>These instructions are for affiliated package authors</em></p>
<p>Once you believe your package is ready to be reviewed by the
PlanetaryPy Project, open a pull request to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/planetarypy/planetarypy.github.io/tree/src">src branch of the
planetarypy.github.io repository</a>,
modifying the <code class="docutils literal">data/registry.json</code> file to add details about your
own package. If you are not comfortable with git, you can do this
by using the 'Edit this File' button (that looks like a pencil which
is to the the upper right of the document, next to the trash can
icon) on the webpage for the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/planetarypy/planetarypy.github.io/blob/src/data/registry.json">registry.json</a>
file.  If you get a message saying <strong>You need to fork this repository
to propose changes</strong> then click on the green button to confirm the
forking:</p>
<img alt="/images/propose_fork.png" src="../../images/propose_fork.png"><p>Copy the following template entry and fill out the
details:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">{
    "name": "Your package name",
    "maintainer": "Your name &lt;your email address&gt;",
    "home_url": "URL to the home page or documentation",
    "repo_url": "URL to the repository",
    "pypi_name": "PyPI name if it exists, set to an empty string otherwise",
    "description": "A few sentence description of your package.",
    "review": {
        "functionality": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
        "ecointegration": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
        "documentation": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
        "testing": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
        "devstatus": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
        "pythonver": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
        "last-updated": "To be filled out by the reviewer"
    }
},</pre>
<p>then add it near the top of the <code class="docutils literal">registry.json</code> file,
after:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">{
  "packages": [</pre>
<p>Once this is done, under <strong>Propose file change</strong> you can enter a short
description for the commit then click on the green <strong>Propose file change</strong>
button:</p>
<img alt="/images/propose_commit.png" src="../../images/propose_commit.png"><p>On the next screen, check the changes you made, and click on the green
<strong>Create pull request</strong> button:</p>
<img alt="/images/propose_create_1.png" src="../../images/propose_create_1.png"><p>Finally, give a title to the pull request such as <strong>Proposed affiliated
package: your package name</strong> and include a short description of the
package, then click on <strong>Create pull request</strong>:</p>
<img alt="/images/propose_create_2.png" src="../../images/propose_create_2.png"><p>Once you've done this, you're all set! The next steps are the review,
for which the results will be posted on the pull request.</p>
</section><section id="reviewing-affiliated-packages"><h2>Reviewing affiliated packages</h2>
<p><em>These instructions are for coordinators and reviewers</em></p>
<p>One of the PlanetaryPy Technical Committee (TC) members will be in
charge of the review process (not necessarily the same person for
each package). This TC member (hereafter the <em>coordinator</em>) will
find someone to carry out the main review of the package (hereafter
the <em>reviewer</em>). In this sense the role of the coordinator is
similar to that of a journal editor.  However this is only partially
true, because the coordinator (speaking for the TC as a whole) may
add their views to the review, unlike a journal editor who is often
strictly impartial on the review itself.  The pool of available
reviewers will be anyone who has an official role on the PlanetaryPy
team.</p>
<p>The coordinator sends out an email to possible reviewers one at a
time to find someone who is willing to review the package, using
the template at the bottom of this document. Let them know at this
point that the coordinator will also be doing a review and synthesizing
the results into a single review. Once a reviewer accepts, the
coordinator sends them an email with detailed review instructions,
using the template at the bottom of this document. The coordinator
then leaves a message on the pull request saying:</p>
<p class="jumbotron">Thank you for proposing this package as an affiliated package! I'm
happy to confirm that your package is now under review and we'll
post the results of the review here.</p>
<p>Once the reviewer has finished, they send their review back by email
to the coordinator, who then does their own review and then writes
up a review using the review template which includes a table with
badges (template at the bottom of this document). They then share
it with the other TC members to check for consensus. The review
including the final decision (accept or reject) is then posted on
the original pull request. If the package is rejected, the original
author has a month to respond to any of the points in the review,
and the coordinator may decide to change the decision.</p>
<p>If the package is accepted, the coordinator edits the pull request
to add the results of the review to the <code class="docutils literal">registry.json</code> file.
The pull request is then merged.</p>
<p>If the package is rejected, the decision is posted to the pull
request, and the pull request is closed.</p>
</section><section id="templates"><h2>Templates</h2>
<p>The following templates are to help the review coordinator communicate
with the reviewer and the applicant.</p>
<section id="template-email-with-review-request"><h3>Template email with review request</h3>
<div class="jumbotron">

<p>Subject: Reviewing a PlanetaryPy-affiliated package submission</p>

<p>Dear/Hi {potential reviewer},</p>

<p>The PlanetaryPy project has received a request to consider the
following as an affiliated package:</p>

<p>Name:<br>
Description:<br>
Repository:<br>
Documentation:</p>

<p>I am reaching out to ask whether you would be willing to review
this package.</p>

<p>To provide some background, an affiliated package is a planetary-related
Python package that is not part of the planetarypy core package,
but is part of the PlanetaryPy Project community. Such a package
should demonstrate a commitment to PlanetaryPyâ€™s goals of improving
reuse, interoperability, and interface standards for Python planetary
packages.</p>

<p>Reviewing a package involves reading over the documentation, having
a look at the code to assess it (e.g. for readability but not read
it line by line), checking how well the package is tested, as well
as assessing its integration with the PlanetaryPy Community and
wider planetary software ecosystem. Most packages can be reviewed
within an hour and reviews are anonymous by default. If you accept
this review, we will send you a detailed list of criteria to check
for the package as well as how to submit your review.</p>

<p>Could you reply to this email to let us know if you would be willing
to review this package?</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>
{coordinator_name}</p>

<p>When you are ready to post the review on the application PR, you
can just copy this whole block of text to the GitHub comment text
box and then get to work modifying it. You'll need to remove the
badges that don't apply and also add text where appropriate in the
table.  There are phrases in the text below that are surrounded by
asterisks, those are meant as comments and should be removed, and
only the text that applies should remain, altered to your liking.</p>

This package has been reviewed for inclusion in the PlanetaryPy
affiliated package ecosystem by a member of the PlanetaryPy community
as well as myself, and I have synthesized the results of the review
here.

*Include any other comments here*

*If accepted and there are no governance documents or only partial governance documents:*
Please remember that if your package doesn't explicitly have a set
of governance documents, that's fine!  The PlanetaryPy Project's
governance models (consensus seeking, code of conduct, etc.)
automatically apply to your project.  If you want something different,
be sure to include it in your package.

*If accepted with all green:*

**Summary/Decision**: Everything looks great, and we're happy to confirm that
this package is accepted as an affiliated package! :trophy:

*If accepted with some orange:*

**Summary/Decision**: This package meets the review criteria for affiliated
packages, so we are happy to confirm that we'll be listing your package as an
affiliated package! Keep up the good work, and we encourage you to improve on
the areas above that weren't "green" yet.

*If there is any red:*

**Summary/Decision**: Thanks for your work on this package! At the moment, we
found some issues in some of the review areas. As per the review guidelines, we
therefore won't be able to accept this package as an affiliated package yet.
We will leave this pull request open for a month in case you would like to
respond to the comments and/or address any of them.

*In all cases:*

If you have any follow-up questions or disagree with any of the comments above,
leave a comment and we can discuss it here. At any point in future you can
request a re-review of the package if you believe any of the scores should be
updated - contact the coordination committee, and weâ€™ll do a new review.
